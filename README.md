# Web Development Practice

Here are some works I've done for practice in web development! 

I am starting out with the basics, but I have worked with React, Javascript, TailWindCSS, and Bootstrap, but realized I wanted a more cohesive basis. 

I'm open to all critiques and suggestions for my road-map to becoming a front-end developer.
